<h1>One After Another :</h1>

<p align="justify">The day has been gone one after another since we born and it will went on till the life end. But there are some resons why we are here. 
Everybody has something special within him. We have to recognize it, we need to put our efforts to find the goal of life.</p>
<p align="justify">We always celebrates a new day but the truth is beyond this and that is we lose one more day which is gifted to us by nature as our beautiful life. 
life is a type of race, in which nobody wants to touch the finish line. I want to share a story here â€œ Long time ago there was a king going somewhere .
he saw a old man giving water to a plant. He asked to him, why are you doing this as you are too old and you will not live to eat the fruit of this
tree. Old man replied, today I am enjoying the fruits from these tress are planted by the people who are not live today. The king was at loss for words
. So this teaches us that we need to do some task without any expectations.</p>
<p align="justify">Now these days money is more important rather than anything and this is right also because we can,t  imaging life without money. Life is not  simple
 as I imaging in my childhood, it has always new challenges to face. In between these we just forgetting aim of life, goal of life, which should be 
 more than important  rather than any other thing in the world and that is responsibility. Responsibility towards our parents, Responsibility towards 
 our motherland, Responsibility towards our work, Responsibility towards The Nature, Responsibility towards anyone who have expectations from us. God 
 gifted us life on a very beautiful planet Earth to live with joy and happiness, to live with love, to live with each other and we are doing very well 
 but there are some bugs also we need to remove them which should be our goal, our aim should be live with love and co-operation, we need to move ahead
 putting our hands together.</p>
<p align="justify">Life is a race it is right, but I think it is a journey day by day we are moving ahead with learning some awesome lessons and experience. In this 
journey there are many more co-travelers. we always know finish line coming to us as the day encounters one after another, we are still happy and 
enjoying every new day one after another.</p>
