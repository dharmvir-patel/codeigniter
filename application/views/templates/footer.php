		Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code
		from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and
		logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by
		minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.</p>
